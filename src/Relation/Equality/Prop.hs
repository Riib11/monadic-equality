# Propositional Equality

Propositional equality has three introduction rules:
- SMT equality of terms entails the propositional equality of the terms,
- extensional propositional equality of functions (i.e. the two have
  propositionally equal outputs given identical inputs) entails the
  propositional equality of the functions,
- contextual propositional equality of terms (i.e. renaming free names in the
  terms can yield propositional equality) entails the propositional equality of
  the terms.
